## 7. Credentials Summary

| Portal | URL | Email | Password | Role |
|--------|-----|-------|----------|------|
| Super Admin | `/admin/super` | `codeofthoth@outlook.com` | `ThothSuperAdmin@2026` | `SUPER_ADMIN` |
| Platform Admin | `/login` | `admin@ruaitechsolutions.co.ke` | `RuaiTech@2026` | `admin` |
| Dept Head (example) | `/admin/{slug}` | Assigned via User Management | Set at creation | `DEPT_HEAD_OWNER` |
| Staff (example) | `/admin/{slug}` | Assigned via User Management | Set at creation | `STAFF` |

---

## 8. Security Notes

- **Super Admin** is identity-locked: role `SUPER_ADMIN` **AND** email `codeofthoth@outlook.com` must both match. Stored in `process.env.SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` — never exposed to the frontend bundle.
- **Department scope** is enforced server-side: all queries from dept panels are filtered by `{ department: req.user.department._id }` — a dept head cannot query another department's data.
- **Super Admin account** has `superAdminLocked: true` in the database — it cannot be modified or deactivated via the standard user update endpoint.
- **JWT tokens** expire after `8h` by default (configurable via `JWT_EXPIRE` in `.env`).
- **M-Pesa callback** (`/api/payments/mpesa/callback`) must be publicly accessible via HTTPS. Use `ngrok http 5000` for local development.
